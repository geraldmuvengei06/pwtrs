                <h2 class="h2 format__title" id="Title-Format" data-autocheck="">Research Paper Writing and Formatting Made
                    Easy With Us</h2>
                <p>Students struggle with citing sources and writing research papers using the appropriate format. Different
                    papers may require different formats, depending on their nature, topics, your professor's preference, or
                    standards set by your institution. There are generally two formats that universities often follow: the
                    APA format and the MLA format.</p>
                <p>The American Psychological Association (APA) format is used for research papers in the fields of hard and
                    soft sciences. On the other hand, the Modern Language Association (MLA) format is developed for studies
                    revolving around literature and language.</p>
                <p>Our experts can effectively help students to use any of the two formats appropriately. They are also
                    well-versed with the latest edition of both formats, thereby ensuring that their citation practices are
                    not outdated.</p>
